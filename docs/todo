Consider using atexit to make sure mem_free is always called when program ends
Add ability to profile using 'gprof'

Reconsider return 'struct matrix' from matrix operations as can lead to some
unusual/unexpected behaviour, such as attempting to multiply two incompatible
matrices. Should
struct matrix matrix_multiply(struct matrix m, struct matrix n);
be replaced with a function that takes storage for the result?:
int matrix_matrix_multiply(struct matrix op1, struct matrix op2, struct matrix *result);
