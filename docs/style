No typedef'ing structs, tuple is 'struct tuple', not 'tuple_t' or 'tuple_type'

Functions should be prefixed clearly, all functions to do with tuples have a
'tuple_' suffix, ie 'tuple_add', haven't decided if the function name itself
should follow camel case or underlines: 'tuple_toString' or 'tuple_to_string',
but if it comes to it i'll probably follow the linux kernal rules (no camel)

static functions should be prefixed with '_', and I suppose the type prefix
can be dropped
